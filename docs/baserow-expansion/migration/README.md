## Migration Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
Recommended for production environments with high availability requirements.

**Advantages:**
- Zero downtime migration
- Easy rollback capability
- Full testing before switch
- Minimal risk

**Requirements:**
- Duplicate infrastructure
- Load balancer configuration
- Database replication setup

### Rolling Migration
Suitable for distributed deployments with multiple instances.

**Advantages:**
- Gradual migration process
- Partial rollback capability
- Reduced resource requirements
- Continuous availability

**Requirements:**
- Compatible versions during transition
- Careful coordination
- Monitoring during process

### Maintenance Window Migration
Standard approach for most installations.

**Advantages:**
- Simpler process

   - Mitigation: Test on copy, optimize queries, use parallel processing

2. **Custom Plugin Compatibility**
   - Risk: Plugin failures
   - Mitigation: Test plugins thoroughly, have rollback plan

3. **Data Loss During Migration**
   - Risk: Corrupted or lost data
   - Mitigation: Multiple backups, validation scripts, rollback procedures

4. **Performance Degradation**
   - Risk: Slower system after migration
   - Mitigation: Performance testing, index optimization, monitoring

### Medium Risk Areas
1. **Configuration Errors**
   - Risk: System misconfiguration
   - Mitigation: Configuration validation, testing procedures

2. **User Experience Changes**
   - Risk: User confusion with new features
   - Mitigation: User training, documentation, gradual rollout

3. **Integration Failures**
   - Risk: External integrations break
   - Mitigation: Integration testing, fallback procedures

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (< 1 hour after migration)
1. Stop new Baserow services
2. Restore database from backup
3. Restore file storage from backup
4. Restart old Baserow version
5. Validate system functionality

### Delayed Rollback (> 1 hour after migration)
