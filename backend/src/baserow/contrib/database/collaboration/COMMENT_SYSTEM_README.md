# Enhanced Comment System Implementation

This document describes the enhanced comment system implementation for Baserow's collaboration features.

## Overview

The enhanced comment system provides comprehensive commenting functionality with @mention support, notifications, and advanced filtering capabilities. This implementation fulfills the requirements for task 17 in the Baserow Monday.com expansion project.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Comment Model with Threaded Support ✅

- **Features**:
  - Threaded comments with parent-child relationships
  - User mentions via many-to-many relationship
  - Resolution status tracking
  - Timestamps for creation and updates
  - Proper indexing for performance

### 2. @Mention Functionality with Notifications ✅

- **Location**: `backend/src/baserow/contrib/database/collaboration/notification_types.py`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic parsing of @user_id patterns in comment content
  - Validation against workspace membership
  - Email notifications for mentioned users
  - Prevention of self-mention notifications
  - Integration with Baserow's notification system

### 3. Comment Permissions ✅

- **Implementation**: Respects existing table and workspace permissions
- **Features**:
  - Users can only comment on tables they have access to
  - Comments are filtered based on user permissions
  - API endpoints validate workspace membership
  - Row-level access control integration

### 4. API Endpoints with Filtering and Pagination ✅

- **Location**: `backend/src/baserow/contrib/database/api/collaboration/views.py`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/database/collaboration/tables/{table_id}/rows/{row_id}/comments/` - List comments with pagination
  - `POST /api/database/collaboration/tables/{table_id}/rows/{row_id}/comments/` - Create comment
  - `PATCH /api/database/collaboration/comments/{comment_id}/` - Update comment
  - `DELETE /api/database/collaboration/comments/{comment_id}/` - Delete comment
  - `POST /api/database/collaboration/comments/{comment_id}/toggle-resolution/` - Toggle resolution

### 5. Advanced Features ✅

- **Comment Updates**: Update content and mentions with notification handling
- **Comment Resolution**: Mark comments as resolved/unresolved
- **Activity Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all comment operations
- **Filtering Options**:
  - Filter by user
  - Include/exclude resolved comments
  - Pagination support
- **Serialization**: Rich serialization with user info and mention details

## API Usage Examples

### Create a Comment with Mentions

```bash
POST /api/database/collaboration/tables/123/rows/456/comments/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "content": "Hello @789 and @101112, please review this task!",
  "parent": null
}
```

### Get Comments with Filtering

```bash
GET /api/database/collaboration/tables/123/rows/456/comments/?user_id=789&include_resolved=false
```

### Update a Comment

```bash
PATCH /api/database/collaboration/comments/123/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "content": "Updated content with new mention @131415"
}
```

### Toggle Comment Resolution

```bash
POST /api/database/collaboration/comments/123/toggle-resolution/
```

## Database Schema

### Comment Model Fields

- `id`: Primary key
- `table`: Foreign key to Table
- `row_id`: Integer ID of the row being commented on
- `user`: Foreign key to User (comment author)
- `content`: Text content of the comment
- `parent`: Self-referencing foreign key for threaded comments
- `created_at`: Timestamp of creation
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of last update
- `is_resolved`: Boolean resolution status
- `mentions`: Many-to-many relationship to User

### Activity Log Integration

New action types added:
- `comment_created`
- `comment_updated`
- `comment_deleted`
- `comment_resolved`
- `comment_unresolved`

## Notification System

### CommentMentionNotificationType

- **Type**: `comment_mention`
- **Email Support**: Yes, with clickable links
- **Features**:
  - Parses @user_id patterns from comment content
  - Validates mentioned users against workspace membership
  - Sends notifications only to newly mentioned users (on updates)
  - Excludes self-mentions
  - Provides rich email templates

## Testing

### Test Files

1. `test_enhanced_comment_system.py` - Integration tests for the complete system
2. `test_comment_mentions.py` - Unit tests for mention functionality
3. `test_comment_api.py` - API endpoint tests

### Test Coverage

- Comment creation with mentions
- Mention parsing and validation
- Comment updates and mention handling
- API endpoint functionality
- Permission validation
- Activity logging
- Threaded comment structure
- Notification system integration

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization

- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Efficient queries with select_related and prefetch_related
- Pagination support for large comment threads

### Caching Strategy

- Comments are fetched with related user and mention data
- Activity logs are efficiently filtered and paginated
- Stale presence and session cleanup

## Security Features

### Permission Validation

- All API endpoints validate workspace membership
- Users can only modify their own comments
- Comment visibility respects table permissions

### Input Validation

- Comment content is validated and sanitized
- Mention parsing uses safe regex patterns
- User ID validation against workspace membership

## Integration Points

### Existing Baserow Systems

- **Notification System**: Integrated with core notification framework
- **Permission System**: Respects existing workspace and table permissions
- **Activity Logging**: Uses existing activity log infrastructure
- **WebSocket Support**: Ready for real-time comment updates

### Registration

The notification type is automatically registered in `backend/src/baserow/contrib/database/apps.py`:

```python
from baserow.contrib.database.collaboration.notification_types import (
    CommentMentionNotificationType,
)
notification_type_registry.register(CommentMentionNotificationType())
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Rich Text Support**: Enhanced formatting options for comments
2. **File Attachments**: Support for attaching files to comments
3. **Emoji Reactions**: Quick reaction system for comments
4. **Comment Templates**: Pre-defined comment templates
5. **Bulk Operations**: Bulk comment operations via API
6. **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated filtering options

### WebSocket Integration

The system is designed to work with real-time updates:
- Comment creation/update events
- Live typing indicators
- Real-time mention notifications
- Activity feed updates

## Conclusion

The enhanced comment system provides a robust foundation for collaboration in Baserow. It implements all required features from the specification:

✅ **Comment model with threaded comment support**  
✅ **@mention functionality with user notifications**  
✅ **Comment permissions respecting table and row access**  
✅ **Comment API endpoints with filtering and pagination**

The implementation follows Baserow's existing patterns and integrates seamlessly with the current architecture while providing room for future enhancements.
