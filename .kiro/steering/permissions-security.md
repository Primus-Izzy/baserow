# Permissions & Security Architecture

## Permission System Design
Implement a comprehensive, hierarchical permission system that provides fine-grained control while remaining user-friendly.

## Permission Levels
- **Workspace Level**: Overall workspace access and management
- **Database Level**: Database-specific permissions
- **Table Level**: Table access and modification rights
- **View Level**: View-specific visibility and editing
- **Field Level**: Individual field permissions
- **Row Level**: Record-specific access control

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Predefined Roles**: Admin, Editor, Viewer, Commenter
- **Custom Roles**: Create custom roles with specific permission sets
- **Role Inheritance**: Hierarchical role inheritance system
- **Role Assignment**: Assign roles at different levels (workspace, table, etc.)

## Advanced Permission Features
- **Conditional Permissions**: Permissions based on field values or user attributes
- **Time-based Permissions**: Temporary access grants
- **IP Restrictions**: Limit access by IP address or range
- **API Key Permissions**: Granular API access control

## Security Measures
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security audit trails
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and brute force attacks
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling and timeout policies

## Privacy Compliance
- **Data Anonymization**: Tools for anonymizing sensitive data
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data export, deletion, and consent management
- **Field Masking**: Hide sensitive fields from unauthorized users
- **Access Logging**: Track who accessed what data when
