# Automation System Architecture

## Automation Engine Design
Build a flexible, scalable automation system that can handle complex workflows while maintaining performance.

## Core Components
- **Trigger System**: Event-driven triggers for record changes, dates, and external events
- **Action Engine**: Modular action system for updates, notifications, and integrations
- **Workflow Builder**: Visual interface for creating and managing automations
- **Execution Queue**: Reliable background job processing for automation actions

## Trigger Types
- **Record Events**: Created, updated, deleted
- **Field Changes**: Specific field value changes
- **Time-based**: Scheduled triggers, date reached
- **External**: Webhook triggers, API calls
- **Conditional**: Complex condition evaluation

## Action Types
- **Data Actions**: Update fields, create records, delete records
- **Communication**: Email, Slack, Teams notifications
- **External**: Webhooks, API calls, file operations
- **Workflow**: Conditional branching, delays, loops

## Performance Considerations
- **Async Processing**: All automation actions run asynchronously
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent automation loops and excessive API calls
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with retry mechanisms
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring of automation execution

## Security & Permissions
- **User Context**: Automations run with appropriate user permissions
- **API Keys**: Secure storage and management of integration credentials
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of automation actions and changes
